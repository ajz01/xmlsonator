{"name":"Xmlsonator","tagline":"A high speed xml to json converter for node built on libxml++.","body":"### Background\r\nI created this project to learn more about creating native add-ons for node. While looking for an interesting project to use as a learning tool, I found that there were many popular JSON to XML parsers that were using native modules that wrapped the native callbacks to javascript exposing them as an API that could be used to customize the parsing process. I began to wonder if a more specialized solution built specifically for XML to JSON conversion on the native side would be faster. Although it's not as flexible since you can't handle parsing callbacks directly on the javascript side, I have found that this approach has been significantly faster (10x in most cases) and could be useful for a project that relies on high volume XML to JSON conversion. To date, this project only supports synchronous blocking calls, but if there is any interest I may add an asynchronous call using libuv threads as an option. I don't want to spend too much time on this if there is really no interest, so testing has been minimal as well, but feel free to try this on some XML and contribute if you want. If I notice some interest in this again I'll be happy to jump in and include more features and testing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
